     * @brief Object to manage ambient light and fog.
     * @details
     * 
     * A LightingArea is a wrapper class to a sf::RenderTexture that provides
     * the required functions to use it as a mask for the light or a layer of
     * extra lighting. This behaviour is specified through the 
     * [operation mode](@ref LightingArea::Mode) of the area.
     * 
     * <table width="100%">
     * <tr>
     *  <td align="center"> <img src="lightingArea01.png" width="300px"> <br> <em>No LightingArea</em> </td>
     *  <td align="center"> <img src="lightingArea02.png" width="300px"> <br> <em>FOG mode (Color black, medium opacity)</em> </td>
     *  <td align="center"> <img src="lightingArea03.png" width="300px"> <br> <em>AMBIENT mode (Color yellow, low opacity)</em> </td>
     * </tr>

     * 
     * It can be used with a plain color or with another sf::Texture as base.
     * If this is the case, such texture must exist and be managed externally
     * during the life of the LightingArea. All changes made to the color,
     * opacity or texture of the area require a call to @ref clear and
     * @ref display to make effect.
     *

     * </div>
     * 
     * As the sf::RenderTexture may be a heavy resource to be creating
     * repeteadly, there are only two moments in which you are able to do so.
     * The first one and most common is upon construction, where you can
     * specify the size of the area, which will also be the size of the
     * sf::RenderTexture. The second one is upon the assignment of a texture
     * (with @ref setAreaTexture), on which the area is created again to match
     * the size of the new texture.
	 *
     * There are two things to note  about this:
     *   1. To change the size of a LightingArea that has already been
     * constructed, without changing the base texture, you have to scale it as
     * you would do with any other sf::Transformable.
     *   2. If you change the texture of the area, its size might also be 
     * modified. So, if you want to change the texture and the size, you must
     * change the texture first and scale it after that.
